# 🕵️‍♂️ Cyber Threat Hunt: Entry Point - "Lurker" Scenario

## 📌 Scenario Overview
The last incident was supposed to be over. One machine compromised, the attacker cut off before they could spread — or so we were told.
But something doesn’t sit right.

A new device started acting strangely. At first glance, it mirrored the earlier compromise, same tools, same timing, same surgical precision. Only this time, the logs were cleaner. Too clean. And yet, traces remained — scattered like breadcrumbs that weren’t meant to be found, or perhaps were meant to be followed.

Someone wants us to see this.

What if the first breach was a smokescreen? A proof of concept? What if this is the real operation?

Some say it’s just a red team op. Others whisper it's something more — a buried framework that’s been lying dormant, waiting for its second trigger.

You’ve been given full access. But not the full story.

Your job is simple: Prove what really happened.
Follow the signs. Trust the data. Question everything.
